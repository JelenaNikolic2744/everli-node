## Text of the task

Create a REST api that handles witness reports.
API clients send a name of a person of interest or a part of the case title, and a phone
number so they can be contacted for more details.
We need to store all of the witness reports in a file, and we should check the validity of the report.

Requirements:
a) Check if there actually is a case that matches in the FBI DB. You can use the open FBI Most Wanted API: https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/api
b) Check the validity of the phone number
c) Check and record the country of the client. This can be deducted from their phone number and/or ip address
